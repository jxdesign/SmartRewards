## About 

Smart Rewards is an SMS (and web) tool to automatically return the best credit card to use depending on the type of purchase you're about to make. Here's a short demo of it below. This is actual reward data for three credit cards I use.

## Submit feedback 

While I do my best to ensure the rewards are accurate, there may be mistakes. If you notice a reward that looks off, or if you have a card that isn't one of the available cards, or any other bugs, feel free to [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/jxdesign/SmartRewards/issues) or contact me via email on my bio.
