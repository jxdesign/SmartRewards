## Submit feedback 

While I do my best to ensure the rewards are accurate, there may be mistakes. If you notice a reward that looks off, or if you have a card that isn't one of the available cards, or any other bugs, feel free to open an issue on Github https://github.com/jxdesign/SmartRewards/issues or contact me via email on my bio.
